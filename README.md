# Simple script that piggy-backs off my easy-arch-ext4 build but also install i3-wm with important programs for myself and maybe for yourself too!

1. Change the mode of the arch-install.sh to allow you to execute it.
```bash
# chmod +x arch-install.sh
```
2. Run it.
```bash
# ./arch-install.sh
```
3. Reboot.
```bash
# exit
# reboot
```
4. You might have to re-pull this git script.
```
$ git clone https://github.com/wretchedghost/easy-arch-gui"
$ cd easy-arch-gui
$ chmod +x post-install.sh
```
5. Run through config...
6. Profit. Maybe...
